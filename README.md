# OrgCommNodeK8

*Despite having a `k8` in the name, this project does not actually utilize K8 orchestration.*

Pre-requisites:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). I have completely stopped using `npm` in favor of yarn due to performance.
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Run the project Docker Container via Docker Compose

In the project root directory, run:
```bash
# run in `detached` mode (recommended):
docker-compose up -d

# Or run attached, you will see both container logs: mongodb init log and running server log
docker-compose up

# to stop containers generated by docker-compose, run:
docker-compose down
```

**Docker compose** will pull & build both the project and the **mongodb** image from docker hub. After *compose* has successfully built the images,
go to http://localhost:1337 to verify that the container is running.


## Endpoints and Default Data

By default, the database has been pre-populated with a set of organizations, comments and members.

**Available organizations** to query from:
- **fsociety**

```

## Build for Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the server:
```bash
yarn start
```

Running `yarn start` will run a seed script via `node seed.js` to insert default set of collections and documents to your local mongodb db.

Run unit and integration tests:
```
yarn test
```

If you're going to develop on your local machine, it is recommended that you use tools like [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for `watch` or `reload`.

```
nodemon index.js
```

### Build docker image

Before you do, you need to create a production config `/config/production.json`:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 1337,
  "db": {
    "connString": "mongodb://mongo:27017/orgcommnode"
  }
}
```
Then run:
```
docker build -t orgcommnode-rest .
```
You can replace the `orgcommnode-rest` tag with any name you want.
